We have Thematic Colors; you’re encouraged to stick to them.
Never push a broken work. If you somehow do, fix it.
Always add detailed documentation to written C# code.
Avoid the Backburner whereatall possible.
Cooperate, not connive. No WYCI, our motto is: “If you don’t do it, then I will.”
Pull Requests are merged alongside the Changelog, not ahead.
Make consecutive, clear and legible notes & bullet-points on commits and Pull Requests.
