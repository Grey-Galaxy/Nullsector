  # Null Sector Shipyards

To assist in developing the Null Sector, shuttles from various organizations were delivered for rented use.
All rentals are temporary. Rented shuttles return to the organizations that provided them when it is either time to evacuate, or when shift time is up.
The value of shuttles is returned to the purchaser when ended through a ship console.
To avoid losses, [bold]make sure you sell your rental before ending a shift[/bold].

  Ships come equipped with the tools and supplies needed to perform one or more tasks in the Null Sector (e.g. mining, research, medical, food services).

Ships, especially larger ones, work best with a crew. Refer to the [bold]Hiring[/bold] section for more info.
Space is a lonely, dangerous place, and you'll have a much better time when you work with a crew.
